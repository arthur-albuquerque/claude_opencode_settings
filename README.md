# Claude Code × OpenCode Go — coordinator/worker settings

> In short, this setup turns Claude Code into a budget-aware coordinator that delegates coding work
> to cheap OpenCode Go workers, verifies every worker result before shipping it, and monitors live
> usage across both services so it pauses before a budget window is exhausted and automatically
> resumes once it resets.
>
> The main goal is to let Claude run long coding sessions by itself with as little human
> intervention as possible.

Global Claude Code configuration for people who run **Claude Code** (Fable 5 / Opus) alongside an
**[OpenCode Go](https://opencode.ai)** subscription. It turns Claude into a *coordinator* that spends
its expensive tokens on judgment — diagnosis, task decomposition, code review, verification — while
delegating the actual typing of code to cheap OpenCode Go models invoked via the `opencode` CLI from
the same session.

The goal: long, productive Claude sessions that don't burn through usage limits, because the bulk
token spend (writing code) happens on a flat-rate $12/5h worker plan instead of on Claude.

## How this branch differs from `framework-as-skill`

This is the `main` branch, where the **entire** framework lives in the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
Every Claude session — even one where you never intend to delegate — loads the whole system prompt:
the coordinator/worker rules, the model table, the delegation contract, the QA loop, *and* the
budget pacing. It's one file, always in context, nothing to invoke.

The [`framework-as-skill`](https://github.com/arthur-albuquerque/claude_opencode_settings/tree/framework-as-skill)
branch **splits the framework by scope** so nothing is forced on a session that doesn't need it:

| Concern | `main` (this branch) | `framework-as-skill` |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Claude-usage-limit pacing** — dead-man's switch, auto-resume loop | In `CLAUDE.md` | In `CLAUDE.md` — stays always-on either way |
| **Coordinator/worker delegation** — the split, model table, prompt contract, QA loop, OpenCode worker budget, viz default | In `CLAUDE.md` — always loaded | Moved to `skills/delegate/SKILL.md`, a **user-invoked skill** (`disable-model-invocation: true`) loaded only when you type `delegate` |

Pick this branch if you want the simplest install (one `CLAUDE.md`, no skill to copy, no plugin
machinery) and you're fine paying the delegation framework's context cost on every session. Pick
`framework-as-skill` if you want plain, non-delegating sessions to pay **zero** context load for
the coordinator/worker rules and to opt into them on demand.

`framework-as-skill` is also packaged as a **Claude Code plugin** (`opencode-coordinator`) and is
the repo's **default branch**, so the plugin installs directly from GitHub:

```text
/plugin marketplace add arthur-albuquerque/claude_opencode_settings
/plugin install opencode-coordinator@claude-opencode-settings
```

This `main` branch deliberately stays plugin-free — a second plugin carrying the same hooks and
doctrine would double-inject warnings and context if both were ever enabled. Install this branch
by copying files (Setup below), or use the plugin from `framework-as-skill` instead.

## What's in here

| File | Installs to | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | The whole system prompt: delegation rules, model table, budget pacing, auto-resume |
| `statusline-command.sh` | `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` | Claude Code status line script that persists `~/.claude/usage-snapshot.json` |
| `hooks/usage-warning.sh` | `~/.claude/hooks/usage-warning.sh` | Hook that auto-injects a budget warning into the agent's context at ≥90% / ≥95% of a Claude usage window |
| `scripts/opencode-go-usage.py` | `~/.claude/scripts/opencode-go-usage.py` | OpenCode Go budget check (authoritative gateway blocked-state probe) |
| `opencode.worker-agent.example.json` | merge into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | The `worker` agent definition that lets `opencode run` edit files non-interactively |

## Features

- **Coordinator/worker split.** Clear rules for what Claude does directly (trivial edits, config,
  git), what it delegates (anything that writes or modifies code), and what it must never delegate
  (diagnosis, architecture, final review).
- **Worker model rankings.** A cost/intelligence/taste table of OpenCode Go models with per-task
  defaults (bulk work → flash, standard specs → deepseek-v4-pro, hard coding → kimi-k2.7-code,
  repo-scale reasoning → glm-5.2) and a standing escalation ladder when output fails review.
- **Delegation prompt contract.** Nine rules that make worker prompts self-contained and
  judgment-free (exact file paths, pre-decided names/approaches, embedded context, built-in
  verification commands, do-not-touch lists), plus a list of banned vague phrases ("refactor as
  needed", "handle edge cases appropriately", …) that force weak models to hallucinate.
- **Non-negotiable QA loop.** After every worker run: read the actual `git diff`, re-run the
  verification command yourself, re-delegate up the ladder or fix residuals directly. The
  coordinator owns commits and everything user-visible.
- **Budget-aware pacing.** Two budgets, two independent signals. The Claude-window signal is the
  `hooks/usage-warning.sh` hook (a required install): it reads `~/.claude/usage-snapshot.json` — a
  machine-readable snapshot written by `statusline-command.sh` on every status-line render using
  the harness's own accounting — and *pushes* the warning straight into the agent's context every
  tool-using turn once a window crosses 90% (heads-up) / 95% (stop directive). The agent never
  polls; the warning comes to it, so the pause no longer depends on the agent remembering to
  check. A proactively-armed dead-man's-switch `ScheduleWakeup` backstops the one case the hook
  can't catch — a hard trip mid-turn on a lagging snapshot. The worker
  plan is checked with `opencode-go-usage.py`, which probes the Go gateway with a 1-token request
  (blocked requests are rejected before billing, so probing is free) and reports blocked-state +
  reset time authoritatively — the only budget signal (there is no key-based percent-used API, so
  the doctrine runs at full tier until the gateway blocks). Rules cover wave sizing and never
  silently dropping work.
- **Auto-resume loop.** When a long autonomous job pauses near a usage limit, the session
  schedules its own wakeups timed to the tripped window's exact reset time (`resets_at` from the
  snapshot, +60s pad — chained hourly only when the reset is more than 1h out), re-checks both
  budgets on each wake with a minimal two-command turn, and resumes the remaining plan the moment
  a window clears — no human restart needed, and no useful time lost to fixed-interval polling.
- **Built for Claude's auto mode.** The coordinator/worker split, built-in verification, and
  auto-resume loop are designed so Claude can drive long coding sessions with minimal human input;
  auto mode is the ideal way to use this setup.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), the
   [opencode CLI](https://opencode.ai) with an OpenCode Go subscription (run `/connect` inside
   opencode once so `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` holds your key), Python 3, and `jq`.
2. Copy `CLAUDE.md` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (or append to yours).
3. Copy `statusline-command.sh` to `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` and wire it into Claude Code.
   The easiest way is to run this inside Claude Code (it will update your `~/.claude/settings.json`):

   ```text
   /statusline use the existing executable script at ~/.claude/statusline-command.sh as the status-line command; it reads JSON from stdin and prints the context-window token count, 5-hour usage percentage with time remaining, and weekly usage percentage with reset time
   ```

   Or add it manually to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "statusLine": {
       "type": "command",
       "command": "~/.claude/statusline-command.sh"
     }
   }
   ```

   The script runs after each assistant message and writes `~/.claude/usage-snapshot.json`, which
   `CLAUDE.md` reads as the authoritative Claude-window budget signal.
4. **Install the usage-warning hook — this is the Claude-window budget signal, not an add-on.**
   Copy `hooks/usage-warning.sh` to `~/.claude/hooks/usage-warning.sh`, `chmod +x` it, then wire it
   into `~/.claude/settings.json` on `PostToolUse` (fires every agentic turn, including autonomous
   `/loop` and `ScheduleWakeup` wakes) and `SessionStart` (fires on resume). If those events already
   have hooks, **append** this entry to their `hooks` array rather than replacing it:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PostToolUse": [
         { "matcher": "*", "hooks": [
           { "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/usage-warning.sh", "timeout": 5 }
         ]}
       ],
       "SessionStart": [
         { "matcher": "*", "hooks": [
           { "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/usage-warning.sh", "timeout": 5 }
         ]}
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   The hook is silent below 90%; at ≥90% it injects a heads-up and at ≥95% a stop directive that
   quotes the pause procedure. It reads only the snapshot (no API calls). Test it before wiring:
   `printf '{"hook_event_name":"PostToolUse"}' | CLAUDE_USAGE_SNAPSHOT=<fixture.json> ~/.claude/hooks/usage-warning.sh`.
5. Copy `scripts/opencode-go-usage.py` to `~/.claude/scripts/`.
6. Merge the `agent.worker` block from `opencode.worker-agent.example.json` into your
   `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. Without it, `opencode run` auto-rejects file edits and
   delegation silently fails.
7. **Disable opencode's Claude Code compatibility.** OpenCode loads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` as a
   fallback instruction file by default. Because that file is written for Claude Code (the
   coordinator), letting opencode read it causes opencode sessions to inherit coordinator rules
   they should not execute, and breaks `opencode run` / direct opencode usage. Add this to your
   shell profile:

   ```bash
   echo 'export OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE=1' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   There is no equivalent key in `opencode.json`; this is the only supported mechanism. If you
   want to keep `.claude/skills` available to opencode but only suppress the `CLAUDE.md` prompt
   fallback, use `OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT=1` instead.
8. Start a Claude Code session anywhere — the global `CLAUDE.md` applies to every project.

## Caveats

- The model table (names, pricing, request quotas) reflects OpenCode Go's catalog as of
  **July 2026**; re-rank when the catalog changes.
- Budget figures assume the $12/5h ($30/wk, $60/mo) Go plan — adjust the numbers in `CLAUDE.md`
  and the script's docstring if yours differs.
- The auto-resume loop only works while the Claude Code session stays open on an awake machine
  (`caffeinate -is` for overnight runs on macOS).
- The Claude-window signal is `usage-warning.sh` pushing the warning into context; it reads
  `usage-snapshot.json`, which `statusline-command.sh` writes only when the status line renders and
  the hook only fires on tool-using turns, so a single big turn can hard-trip before any warning —
  the dead-man's-switch `ScheduleWakeup` is the backstop for that. `opencode-go-usage.py` reports
  only the authoritative gateway blocked-state (there is no key-based percent-used API for OpenCode
  Go); it is the sole worker-budget signal.
